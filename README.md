# Decathlon Case - Decathlon challenger app
For the case I created a bucketlist sports challenger app. 
With this app the Decathlon users will be challenged to perform all sports at least once. 
When you click on the sport you get more info about the sport (if available), an overview of places where the sport can be performed, and decathlon products that you probably need.

## Optimisations:
- Appending 700 items is a bit heavy, is there a better solution?

## Nice to haves:
- Login / Account to keep track of progress
- Ranking of persons showing the best progress
- Recommend equipment / products for a specific sport
- Upload image to proof the user performed the sport
- Show Apple maps or Google maps with POI of sport places
- Shuffle sports

## Under the hood
- Vue
- Axios
- Vitamin
- Vite
- Eslint
- Babel

User yarn to install packages, and yarn dev to get it running locally.
